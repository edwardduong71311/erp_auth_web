        A paragraph is a group of sentences that work together to support a main
        idea. Paragraphs are a common way to organize writing and help readers
        understand the structure of an essay. Here are some things to consider
        when writing paragraphs: Structure A paragraph is typically made up of
        three parts: a topic sentence, body sentences, and a concluding
        sentence. The topic sentence introduces the main idea, the body
        sentences support it, and the concluding sentence summarizes the main
        idea. Length A paragraph is usually around five or six sentences long,
        but the length can vary depending on the purpose of the paragraph and
        the length of the piece. A paragraph can be as short as one sentence to
        add emphasis, or it can be longer than five sentences to present more
        evidence. Organization Paragraphs can be organized in different ways,
        such as spatially, by order of appearance, or by topic. Purpose A good
        paragraph answers three questions: what the writer is trying to tell the
        reader, why its important, and how the reader should use the
        information. Contrast Separate paragraphs can be used to contrast ideas
        or sides in an argument or debate.{" "}
